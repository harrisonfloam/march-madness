TODO: tournament management
- for each matchup, get a prediction and propogate it
- Tournament class? spawns Game class for each level or something
- outcome can be completely seperate from tournament, tournament just manages the state
- expose some attribute that holds the current unplayed games so we can loop through them and prediction
- needs a method to update the outcome of the game, then that updates the next matchups...

TODO: make predictions: LLM
- just send the current matchup and some amount of context, return only the expected winner and a confidence or something?
- the context/details about teams should be held seperately somewhere, so we just access it with the name of the team
- make sure we set seed... or should we? could set it as a param for the prediction function, alternate in simulation
- features:
    - team details
    - current tournament state
    - player details

TODO: tournament simulator
- monte carlo style
- takes prediction_strategy callable param
